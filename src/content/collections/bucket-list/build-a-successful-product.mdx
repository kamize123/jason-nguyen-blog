## What Success Means

For me, success isn't just about the revenue. It's about:
- Solving a real problem for users
- Learning the full product development cycle
- Building something I'm proud of
- Creating value for others

## Lessons Learned So Far

- Talk to users early and often
- Ship fast, iterate faster
- Marketing is as important as building
- Focus on solving one problem really well

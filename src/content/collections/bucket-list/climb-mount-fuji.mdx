## Why Mount Fuji?

After visiting Japan, I fell in love with the country. Climbing Mount Fuji would be the ultimate physical and spiritual experience.

### What I Need to Prepare

- Physical fitness (regular hiking and cardio)
- Proper gear (hiking boots, warm clothing, headlamp)
- Research best climbing season (July-August)
- Book mountain hut reservations
- Learn about altitude sickness prevention

## The Goal

Reach the summit (3,776 meters) and watch the sunrise. They call it "Goraiko" - honorable coming of the light.

## Timeline

Hoping to do this within the next 3-5 years, possibly combining it with another Japan trip.

## The Plan

Signed up for the New York City Marathon next year! Currently building my running base.

### Training Schedule

- **Months 1-2:** Build base mileage (20-30 miles/week)
- **Months 3-4:** Increase weekly mileage (30-40 miles/week)
- **Months 5-6:** Peak training with long runs (40-50 miles/week)
- **Month 7:** Taper and race

### Current Stats

- Longest run so far: 10 miles
- Current weekly mileage: 25 miles
- Average pace: 9:30/mile

## Why This Matters

It's not just about crossing a finish line. It's about proving to myself that I can commit to a long-term goal and push through physical and mental barriers.

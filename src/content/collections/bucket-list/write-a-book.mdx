## The Vision

A book that combines technical insights with personal development advice for software engineers. Something I wish I had when starting my career.

### Potential Topics

- Building a sustainable career in tech
- Balancing technical excellence with soft skills
- Learning effectively in a fast-changing field
- Building products users love
- Maintaining work-life balance

## Current Progress

- Collecting ideas and insights in a Notion database
- Writing regularly on my blog (practice!)
- Reading books about writing

## Next Steps

1. Decide on the main theme and structure
2. Create a detailed outline
3. Set a writing schedule (500 words/day)
4. Find beta readers
5. Research publishing options (traditional vs self-publishing)

## Timeline

Aiming to have a first draft within 2 years. It's a long-term goal but one I'm excited about.
